00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walter.

00:03.040 --> 00:08.240
She was a trailblazing journalist who spent more than half a century in broadcast news

00:08.240 --> 00:09.840
throughout her iconic career.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.680
Barbara Walter shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling, breaking bears,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.920
and an industry once dominated by men.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.400
And paving the way for today's female journalists.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.320
She was the first ever woman to co-host NBC's Today Show.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.880
And later, the first woman to anchor a network evening news broadcast.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.600
In a tweet on Saturday, President Biden said, quote,

00:29.600 --> 00:35.520
Barbara Walter's has always been an example of bravery and truth breaking barriers while driving

00:35.520 --> 00:40.400
our nation forward. Her legacy will continue as an inspiration for all journalists.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.840
Barbara Walter's conducted hundreds of interviews with newsmakers from the world of politics,

00:45.840 --> 00:50.880
sports, and entertainment. She was famous for asking tough questions and sometimes uncomfortable

00:50.880 --> 00:55.600
questions and forgetting some of the world's most famous people to reveal parts of themselves,

00:55.600 --> 01:01.120
the public had not seen before. Here she was on Meet the Press back in February 1976,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.240
pressing then the Prime Minister of Israel.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.040
We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.720
Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a

01:12.720 --> 01:16.480
militarily strong Israel is necessary to maintain the peace.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.280
Now, the Pentagon and the CIA have reported after their military analysis that Israel is more

01:21.280 --> 01:26.400
than strong enough to deter any Arab aggression. Were you able to convince Congress and President

01:26.400 --> 01:31.600
forward those who are responsible for deciding military aid to Israel that you are right

01:31.600 --> 01:33.920
and that the CIA and the Pentagon are wrong?

01:34.480 --> 01:40.240
Well, first of all, I'd like to thank the CIA and the Pentagon for complementing Israel

01:40.240 --> 01:48.560
for its military strengths. But I believe that we need more than compliments. We need hard work.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.080
Mr. Prime Minister, we've heard these arguments now back and forth for a year.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.880
And I'd like to get back to my very first question, which was how do you expect to have a Geneva

01:56.880 --> 02:02.560
conference? We convened without the PLO. Can you give us any sign, any hope, any direction?

02:02.560 --> 02:08.560
Can you realistically be specific about one new action that's going to break the stalemate,

02:08.560 --> 02:13.040
the same conversation back and forth that we've heard from the year? Has anything happened in

02:13.040 --> 02:16.160
this week or are things basically the way they were before you came to this country?

02:16.160 --> 02:21.600
I believe that there are basically two options. How to move to its peace.

02:21.600 --> 02:49.040
Incredible to watch her do her work. Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City. She was 93 years old.
